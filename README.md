# Py.Calculat0r
Py.Calculator - 2025

Py.Calculat0r includes:
- Arithmetic functions
- Percentages
- The number π
- Trigonometric functions
- Logarithms
- Square root and cubic root
- Exponentiation
- Factorial
- Writing to memory
- Hyperbolic functions

Half of the code is written in Russian (the developer is from Russia). The project will continue to be updated - the brackets that I did not manage to implement (but will implement soon) are next. 

Written in Python.

The code says that this is a "Simple Calculator" ("Простой калькулятор" in Russian), as this was the original name of the application, which was later renamed to Py.Calculat0r.
