Half of the code is written in Russian (the developer is from Russia). The project will continue to be updated - the brackets that I did not manage to implement (but will implement soon) are next. 

Written in Python.

The code says that this is a "Simple Calculator" ("Простой калькулятор" in Russian), as this was the original name of the application, which was later renamed to Py.Calculat0r.
